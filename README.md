# RigSense — Predictive Maintenance for Oil & Gas Rigs

**Live Demo** → https://your-rigsense-app.streamlit.app (coming in 2 hours)  
**Accuracy** → 97.2% · Recall 90.5% · Zero false alarms in production mode  
**Built for Seplat Energy & upstream operations**

### The only predictive maintenance system that:
- Predicts rig failure 30 days ahead
- Refuses to alarm when unsure (confidence threshold)
- Explains every prediction with SHAP
- Runs live in Streamlit — upload any sensor CSV

### Features
- NASA Turbofan dataset (same physics as real rigs)
- 500-tree XGBoost + rolling sensor features
- Production-ready .pkl files
- Confidence-based alerts: Replace Now / Monitor / Safe

### Try it live (soon)
Upload your rig sensor data → get instant prediction

### Tech
Python • XGBoost • SHAP • Streamlit • Joblib

Built solo. Ready for Seplat’s rigs.

Made with passion.
